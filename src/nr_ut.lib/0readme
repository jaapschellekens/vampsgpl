libnru.a -- Small matrix library based on the nrutils public code 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

J. Schellekens Feb, 1997

Adapted in several ways:
 - Removed the K&R stuff, use gcc (or other ANSI compiler) for compilation

 - Added documentation, see 0nr_ut.txt, 0nr_ut.tex or 0nr_ut.trf for
   ascii, LaTeX or troff documentation.

 - If you need one of the MIN/MAX macros first define NR_{MACRONAME}
   _BEFORE_ including nrutil.h. This is to get gcc silent with -Wall.
   
 - nr_[dfi]mread and nr_[dfi]mwrite functions (to read and write ascii
   matrixes) have been added. Note that NR_END should be _ZERO_ to use
   these functions. nr_[dfilc]write functions for writing vectors
   also added.

 - some basic statistics by R. Venneker added

 - If compiled with -DNR_LIST a list of all vectors and matrixes
   added by a call to one of the allocation functions is maintained
   together with size info. This list can also serve as a garbage
   collector. The list is an array of structures (type defined in
   nrutil.h). Freeing matrixes etc. becomes much easyer, just call:

   	nr_free(1,(void *)your matrix or vector);

   This only works if you made you matrix (or vector) with one of the
   supplied routines. The syntax of the creation functions remains the
   same as the original ones. You can also use the 'old' free_* functions.
   A matrix/vector can be written to an (ascii) file with one of the
   type specific functions or (easyer) with the nr_genw function:

   	nr_genw("This is my file",(void *)your matrix or vector);


 - I also added a simple memory leak check (counts the number of
   calls to make and free vector/matrix calls. Enable with -DNR_MEM_DEBUG
   Should not be needed is you use the list functions, intended for debugging
   only.

 - log.c contains functions to facilitate error reporting and logging to
   multiple streams.

TODO
----
- matrix to vector routines
- Add support for the convert_* routines
- update nr_stat stuff
