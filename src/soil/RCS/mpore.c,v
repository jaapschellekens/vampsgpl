/* 

macropore/bypass flow in vamps some thoughts on setup


1) fraction mpore of total porosity in each node

2) fraction conducting pores in hor and vert dir

3) some kind of flow resistance factor (k_mpore) in hor and vert dir.
   - simple resistance given by user
   - calculated from mpore dimensions?

4) diminish matrix porosity with mpore fraction?

5) deal with diffusion from mpore into matrix. 2 completely seperate
   systems seems unrealistic. mp_res calculated from average k_mpore
   and K(un)sat in matrix. Assuming less mpores with depth a certain
   fraction of the pores can drain but a fraction (difference between
   nodes) can only flow into the matrix.
