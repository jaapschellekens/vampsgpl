Outline for new canopy/topsystem module
---------------------------------------

- A brand-new (less compex but better ;-) ) top-system, canopy module
  is in the make in the topsys dir

- Four functions called from main:
	1	init_top(type) to initialize the system
	2	pre_top - initialize module
	3	tstep_top - each timestep
		should return four values for soil module:
		interception   --> zero if no canopy
		precipitation
		transpiration  --> zero if no canopy
		soilevaporation

	4	post_top - clean module

  These functions should be pointers to the actual functions that get
  set according to the type of topsystem (i.e. no canopy, simple canopy
  or full water balance). These pointers should be set in init_topsys.


Usage
-----
First init_top should be called with a flag determining which functions
should be used.  After pre_top is called tstep_top can be called at each
timestep post_top can be called to clean up stuff.


How to determine required data?
-------------------------------
1)	check if interception, precipitation, transpiration and soilevap
	are in mem or can be read from file. If so nothing more to do!
