libdef -- process parameter files
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

libdef is a library for processing .ini files (what's in a name). The
syntax of the files is the same as used by the samba program. These
files can be used to store program defaults/input and output.

libdef has some special options to make working with large files
fast. libdef can use and create index files files for faster access and
also read entire files into memory. Default and override values can be
used as well.
