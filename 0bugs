~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"Calculation" Bugs
------------------

- Rutter interception is not working properly

- Gash should only be used for daily input 



General Bugs
------------

- more than one space after a filename in the input file is _not_
  stripped!

- the help pager does not work in the msdos version. This means
  you might have trouble reading help screens longer than 25 lines.

- SL-keyboard stuff sometimes failes when switching mode. Use
  SLang_init_tty; to fix in interactive mode.

- smoothing does not work with tables. Broken completely in >99b

- a sigfpe is generated in the msdos version if the input file
  cannot be opened.

- Crash if no determine variable is set

- popen never returns NULL and does not set errno
  fixed by intercepting SIGPIPE and restarting the program. Only
  tested on UNIX systems.

- the maq stuff can crash very easely (just call maqend with a nonsense
  argument...)

- warning messages and logging a bit of a mess at the moment
