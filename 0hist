Some history -- most of the changes are _not_ documented
here, but are included in the RCS stuff.
---------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 26 14:04:23 MET 1995
	Started on framework version 0.1

Fri Jan 27 14:24:52 MET 1995
	Made old2new
	soil.c was added, the program can now read
	all the soil input vars from the new file format.

Wed Feb  1 09:27:32 MET 1995
	Rearranged datastructure of time series, all data are
	stored in a giant, growing, structure containing seperate arrays
	of structures for each data-set

Thu Feb  2 15:59:11 MET 1995
	Added getopt from gzip, program now also uses long
	options. tailor.h commented out.
	Used #ifndef PI. Not defined in sun libc, but included
	in gnulibc.

Sat Feb  4 11:37:58 GMT+0100 1995
	Added -Output option. All datasets can now be printed
	by specifying their name in the -Output option
	Programmed getsetbyname()
	Renamed environ.c to dataset.c. Added output.c which
	maintains the list of sets that should be printed.

Mon Feb 27 13:36:28 MET 1995
	cprosper: used __P macro, updated for ts2.1 
	removed pro_alloc.c

Sat Apr 22 17:35:35 MET DST 1995 (Puerto Rico)
	dumpset now dumps to a file with the name of
	the set if no stream is given.

Mon Jun 26 11:37:10 MET DST 1995
	changed command line syntax (prosper.c)
	moved different parts of program in separate directories
	added rutter stuff using JS brute force solution
	program now reads an .cprosper defaults file
	input files can now be read into memory for faster processing
	started on manual in LaTeX format

Thu Aug  3 16:30:27 MET DST 1995
	added 'benny' richards stuff (obsolute)
	added about 60% of swatr91 soil stuff
	bug in libm.so.4 requires static linking under Linux (SUNOS ok)

Tue Oct 24 10:55:21 MET 1995
	most history now in RCS stuff
	added os2 (emx) support
	this version actually works and produces the same results 
	as swap94 (20% faster!)

Tue Dec  5 08:56:59 MET 1995
	- added look-up tables option, speed inprovements (i486DX) up
	  to 50%
	- This is version 0.95

Sun Dec 17 23:10:42 MET 1995
	look up tables work sometimes
	lots of small improvements
	This is version 0.96

Thu Feb  8 09:11:38 MET 1996
	- This is version 0.97
	- Added support for eading TOPOG soil tables
	- Started on doc
	- Timestep no longer fixed, but determined from x-column in 
	  precipitation file. Compile with -DTRY_SUBDAY to get this
	  At present this work correct _only_ for the soil module,
	  precipittion and interception. The rest can be used from the
	  ts section, but must be calculated otherwise.
	  
Mon Feb 19 11:05:39 MET 1996
	- version 0.975 removing cc (sun) support, only  ANSI C allowed

This is version 0.98
--------------------
Sun Mar 24 20:37:47 MET 1996
	- version 0.98 subdaily seems to work, remove -DTRY_SUBDAY
	- added band diagonal solution when zero pivot occurs 
	- added saturation hack (works!)

This is version 0.99
--------------------
Thu Aug  8 10:48:56 MET DST 1996
	- version 0.99 added S-Lang support, uses begin, per-timestep
	  and an end function defined in vamps.sl (or other name if set
	  in defaults file) Vamps should now be _very_ flexible!!
	- if the -I option is specified vamps will perform as an S-Lang
	  interpreter of the file given in the last argument on the
	  command line.

Thu Sep 19 14:16:32 MET DST 1996
	- Added the -F option for a completely interactive mode. The main()
	  function in vamps.c can now be substituted for a S-Lang function 
	  (see run.sl for an example).
	- changed layout of soilut stuff. Which theta2k function called
	  is now determined by a function pointer in the soilparm structure
	  (for each layer). This saves a few if statements in the inner loop
	  and facilitated adding new soil methods.

Wen Sep 25 14:16:32 MET DST 1996
	- Added experimental support for fitting using the marquardt lib

Sun Nov 10 11:12:49 MET 1996
	- added some S-Lang scripts for use as input file generator
	- mass balance and qtop now OK if profile saturated!

Tue Nov 19 14:42:22 MET 1996
	- Changed filltable to account for slope of theta versus k
	  relation (using ts_slopes). Seems to work although 
	  sensitive for amount of oversaturation.

Fri Nov 29 10:27:00 MET 1996
 	- fixed mass balance calculation (actually qtop in headcalc) with
	  zero flow bottom and complete saturation. Lysimeter setup with
	  zero flow bottom and horizontal drainage in bottom node now
	  possible.
	- started macro-pore setup. Should be completely seperate (code-wise)
	  from 'normal' flow. At present all between MPORE ifdefs. Proposed
	  setup described in soil/mpore.c

This is version 0.99b
---------------------
Mon Dec  9 11:35:13 MET 1996
	- add sp struct which contains all soil specific info.
	- renamed soilparm to node. Struc contains pointer to soiltype (sp)
	- inputfile changed. Soil specific stuff no langer in layer_n but
	  in seperate soiltype sections
	- updated vamps.5 and userg.tex to reflect input file changes

Sat Dec 21 21:19:51 MET 1996
	- added slpath and evalfile/autoload from slasl 0.40
	- started source and S-Lang code documutation using sldoc

Tue Dec 31 15:04:23 MET 1996
	- added support for S-Lang theta/head/dmc/k_unsat functions
	  the file func.sl in sllib contains an example. Best to use
	  mktable with this option to prevent Vamps from becoming
	  _VERY_ slow.
	  
	  
This is version 0.99c
---------------------

Tue Jan 21 00:44:55 MET 1997
	- removed goto labels from headcalc.c
	- started reducing number of global vars in soil module.
	  Results in larges function headers
	- removed unit bugs from actevap and potevap stuff
	  Both files should be cleared up en documentation should be
	  updated.

Fri Jan 24 13:45:06 MET 1997
	- added support for picking columns
		filename,xcol,ycol in ts input section

Sun Jan 26 20:46:43 MET 1997
	- checked bottom condition 1, given qbot -> seems to work, 
	  maybe some roundoff problems.

Mon Jan 27 10:47:32 MET 1997
	- checked bottom condition 4, given h at bottom node

Tue Jan 28 20:06:26 MET 1997
	- added support for drytime given by user

Mon Feb  3 20:09:10 MET 1997
	- added h_itt in headcalc.c. Removes solvebyband variable and
	  replaced it with solvemet variable
	- Most array and matrix vars now allocated with nrutil.c stuff

Wed Apr  2 14:15:41 MET DST 1997
	- start which implementation new topsystem. script and precalculated
	  systems seem to work. Enable with TRY_TOPSYS define. Example in
	  example/lys dir.

Wed Apr 23 09:04:15 MET DST 1997
	- renamed the lib dirs (ending now in .lib)
	- new topsys near completion
	- added penman.slx script
	- C function documentation in all subdirs (via sldoc)

Fri May  9 11:24:51 MET DST 1997
	- added new convergence check in headcalc.c using a simple
	  mass balance check. seems to work well in same cases.
	  Enable with: [soil] mbck = 1
	- changed some for loops in headcalc.c to memcpy. Only used
	  if HASMEMCPY is defined. Some speedup.
	- major changes in internal structure deffile.lib. Uses
	  less memory now and should be more statble. Multiple
	  files can now be kept in memory
	- snapshot release of 0.99c. Documentation is _NOT_ up to
	  date. 0.99d should be the final version before 1.0!
	
This is version 0.99d
---------------------
        - added S-Lang based keypressed check in main loop because
	  signals under djgpp do not seem to work with my code. Pressing
	  spacebar in a run cuases the program to switch to interactive
	  mode

	  
This is version 0.99e
---------------------
	- configure now used to generate Makefiles and vconfig.h
	- added AGL graphics lib S-Lang interface
	- added libplot test graphics (internal and external)
	- added graphics interface to gnuplot. This is the main
	  graphics mode. On systems without the popen call AGL
	  graphics can be used.
	- Released SunOS and Linux bin. Both seem to work

Thu Oct 30 19:52:04 MET 1997
	- refined configure.in
	- added some high level plotting functions (subplot)
	- fixed some typo's in 0* files
	- updated makefile in doc/ subdir

Wed Nov 19 09:03:58 MET 1997
	- tried to fix bugs reported by R.V, most related to
	  configure on HP


This is version 0.99f
---------------------
Fri Nov 21 08:55:28 MET 1997
	- started on nhc.c -> rewritten soil moisture module. Uses the
	  TOPOG approach with the U translation.

Fri Dec 12 22:33:21 MET 1997
	- optimized getval -> included hunting phase. Is now +- 20 % faster

Wed Jan 14 09:05:49 MET 1998
	- fixed bug in sl interface of ra in lib.met (gave wrong answers)
-------------- Development frozen a new 1.0 tree is started, only bug fixes
-------------- from now

	- fixed double close bug in closedef (actually a hack)
	- added soil plot code (in Slang) see demo.sl

Fri Jan 30 14:56:53 MET 1998
	- added default and override lists in deffile.lib

Nov 30 1998
	- added _cumtra et al to correct rounding problems (see 
	  swatsoil.c and integral .c)

Wed Jan 6 14:44:49 1999
