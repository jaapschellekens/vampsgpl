       * - files in vamps output/input format


DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       vvaammppss  (see vvaammppss(1) for a description) reads it's options
       and most of the data needed for modeling  from  the  input
       file. This file is in plain ascii format and is divided in
       several sections.  An input file must  be  created  before
       running vvaammppss.  An ascii editor or a word-processing pack-
       age can be used to create the  input  file.   This  manual
       page can be used a a reference when creating an input file
       for vamps. You probably can have a faster start by looking
       in  the  examples  directory and taking one of the example
       files as a start.

       The input file format for vamps  is  much  like  Microsoft
       Windows  .ini  files.   All  names  and  sections are case
       insensitive.  The case of string variables is unaltered so
       filenames  are  case-sensitive if the operating system is.
       The file is divided into sections which each contain vari-
       ables  that  have  some  connection with each other.  Each
       variable name is followed by an  equal  sign  ('=')  after
       which the value of the variable is placed.  Example:

       [vamps]
       verbose = TRUE
       # This is a comment
       [environment]
       caseid = Interception test file. Bisley catchment.\
       Summer of 1995

       The  \  character may be use to break up long strings over
       more than one line. Only the first '='  sign  is  signifi-
       cant.  Spaces  within  the  names are copied verbatim, and
       thus become part of the name.  This  makes  the  following
       construction  legal:

       [vamps]
       output mode = This is ('=') a nonsense.br example.

       In this case the variable name in section 'vamps' is 'out-
       put mode' and it's value is  'This  is  ('=')  a  nonsense
       example'.

       vvaammppss  uses  six  types of variables: _(_1_) floats (floating
       point numbers), _(_2_) arrays (a row of floating  point  num-
       bers  separated  by  whitespace), _(_3_) strings (a series of
       characters), _(_4_)  integers  (whole  signed  numbers),  _(_5_)
       characters ( a single printable character) and _(_6_) boolean
       (special kind of integer, either 0 or 1 (FALSE  of  TRUE),
       NO or YES).

       This section list all the variables and section recognized
       by the vvaammppss model. You will need  this  list  badly  when
       you construct an input file for vamps. Once the  graphical
       preprocessor is finished  things   will  become  a  little
       easier.

       vvaammppss has been developed using the sswwaapp9944 FORTRAN  code as
       a starting point.   Most names  of   variables  have  been
       changed  (sorry)  but   some   of  the variable names   as
       well  as  their physical meaning have not altered.

       Although  you  don't  have  to use the canopy module it is
       recommend that you do so if possible. The other methods of
       determining  transpiration, interception etc. don't have a
       close interaction with the soil modules and  usually  pro-
       vide poorer results.

       The  ts  section  has one entry that _m_u_s_t be present: pre.
       This set contains the precipitation data.  The  precipita-
       tion  file  is  important  because  it also determines the
       time-steps at which output is calculated.

       The file format consists of colums separeted by whitespace
       (space  or  tabs).  VVaammppss assumes the first column to hold
       the time and the second column to hold the value. You  can
       override these assumptions by appending  ,xcol,ycol to the
       filename. Counting begins at zero.

       The ts  section  can  be  handy  if  you  don't  like  the
       method(s)  which vvaammppss can use for determining things like
       potential evaporation.  Simply put them in here and  vvaammppss
       will use the values you supplied instead.

       The following sets are allowed in the ts section:


       ppeevv    name  of  file with potential evaporation data [cm]
              (if not calculated)

       ppttrr    name of file with potential transpiration data [cm]
              (if not calculated)

       pprree    name of file with precipitation data [cm]

       rrddpp    name  of  file with rooting depth [cm] in time. You
              need to specify at least three points. Other points
              will  be  interpolated using a spline is they don't
              exist. See the file ts_spl.c for the  interpolation
              routine.

       qqbboo    name  of  the  file  with given flux at bottom node
              [cm] (bottom condition 1). You need to  specify  at

       ddttmmiinn  minimum timestep (in days) in soil module.  If  you
              set dtmin and dtmax to equal values vvaammppss is forced
              to use a fixed  timestep.   If  you  suspect  vvaammppss
              could  run  faster  increasing  this variable could
              help. On the other hand itterations  in  vamps  are
              very  expensive (in time) so if vamps starts itter-
              ating a lot to get convergence you'll end up with a
              slow run.

       mmaaxxiittrr Maximum  number  of  iterations in the soil module.
              Iterations are only performed if noit != 1.

       tthheettooll Theta tolerance. If noit != 1  (by  default)  vvaammppss
              will  use  this  value  to check if the solution is
              good enough and perform iterations if needed.  Set-
              ting  this value to high or low gives poor results.
              The default value usually works fine. If  you  have
              no  problems  you better leave this one alone. Usu-
              ally this variable should  be  between  1.0E-2  and
              1.0E-5.  See also mmbbcckk

       mmbbcckk   If set to one vvaammppss uses a simple mass balance cal-
              culation to check convergence  in  stead  of  using
              tthheettooll..  This method is experimental but it is usu-
              ally faster (depending on the mmbbaalleerrrr variable) for
              the  same  accuracy  as  the original method (usign
              thetol).  The thetol  variable  is  still  used  in
              estimating the initial timestep.  See also mmbbaalleerrrr

       mmbbaalleerrrr
              If  mmbbcckk is set you can use this variable to deter-
              mine than required mass balance  accuracy  at  each
              timestep. A value between 1.0E-2 and 1.0E-5 is usu-
              ally the best. Default is 0.5E-3

       ssoollvveemmeett
              Determines how vamps solves  the  equation  matrix.
              If  set  to 0 the default (tridiagonal) solution is
              used.  If set to 1  the  soil  module  will  always
              treat  the  solution  as a band-diagonal matrix. If
              set to 2 a very  general  solution  is  used.  This
              solution  includes  a  step  to regain full machine
              precision but is rather slow.

       nnooiitt   If set to 1 the soil module won't check for conver-
              gence  of  solution.   It  assumes that the initial
              maximum dt is a good guess. Things can  be  quit  a
              lot  faster  in all cases but can give poor results
              in some cases.

              option  is  set  to  false. Set to true to speed up
              calculation. The solution can  become  instable  at
              high  suction heads. In stead of letting vvaammppss gen-
              erate the look-up tables you can also read pre-made
              tables  using the method option in the layer_n sec-
              tion.

              Depending on the problem, the amount of memory  you
              have  installed,  the floating-point performance of
              you CPU and the  optimizations  your  compiler  can
              make, this option can speed up calculations by 50%.
              You will lose some precision  in  the  process.  By
              default  the  program  uses 300 points long look-up
              tables. Use the tablesize variable in the soil sec-
              tion to change this value.

              There  is  no  exact  way  to  determine  the speed
              increase you will get.  For  example,  on  a  66Mhz
              486DX2  running  Linux,  a  25%  speed increase was
              established  without  compiler  optimization  (gcc)
              while  a  50%  speed  increase was measured when de
              program was compiled with  optimization.  It  seems
              that  gcc  does a better job optimizing the look up
              procedure than the intensive floating point  calcu-
              lations  in  the  van Genuchten equation. On a RISC
              processor with better  floating  point  performance
              this  balance  will  be different, and you probably
              won't get speed increases of 50%. On a  rs6000  365
              running  AIX  3.2 the mktables option resulted in a
              23% speed increase.


       eessttddmmcc if set to true and the mktable var is also true the
              dmc  table  will be made using ts_slopes and the Pf
              curve in stead of the h2dmc function. If you use S-
              Lang  soil  functions  and  you define estdmc to be
              true you don't need the h2dmc function.


       ttaabblleessiizzee
              Sets the size of the look-up  tables.  Defaults  to
              300. Increase this for better accuracy at a penalty
              of using more memory  and  some  performance  loss.
              Provided  the program fits in physical memory table
              sizes up to  1200  points  still  give  some  speed
              improvements  compared  to  not  using  the look-up
              tables.  Sometimes decreasing this to 80 or so  can
              be done without much loss of accuracy.

       dduummppttaabblleess
              If set to true the look up tables will be dumped to
              the initial section of the output-file; x and y  in

              If set to  1  the  input  file  is  also  processed
              through the S-Lang interpreter. You will need ifdef
              structures to make sure only S-Lang code is used by
              the interpreter.  Example:
              #ifdef VAMPS
              put S-Lang code here..
              #else
              Put 'normal' input instuctions here..
              #endif
