       ssllddoocc  is an executable vvaammppss(1L) script which facilitates
       documentation for  S-Lang  command  (and  C  source  code)
       files.   Documentation  text is extracted from comments in
       the command files, which are  usually  placed  in  library
       directories. All output is printed on standard output.

       The  first  form extracts documentation text from C source
       code files. If the output is saved in a  file,  that  file
       can be used by the other forms.

       The second form above builds an index table for use by the
       third form from the named S-Lang _f_i_l_es (by convention suf-
       fixed  with  ``..ssll'')  and/or  files  created  with the --cc
       option. Index files need to be (re)created whenever  docu-
       mentation  entries (see below) are added to, removed from,
       or renamed in library files by redirecting the final  out-
       put to a file named ssllddoocc..iiddxx.

       The third form above prints the documentation text for all
       _n_a_m_es on standard output, using the index  information  in
       the  file  ssllddoocc..iiddxx.   A _n_a_m_e is either an S-Lang library
       command name or the name of a library file, for which  all
       entries  are then printed. If invoked without options, raw
       ascii mode is used. The --ll option formats output  for  use
       with  LLaaTTeeXX;  the  --tt option formats output for use by the
       ggrrooffff, nnrrooffff and/or ttrrooffff typesetting programs.

       Documentation text is contained within comment  blocks  in
       the  appropriate  S-Lang  command  files and follows a few
       simple conventions outlined below.  See for  examples  the
       files in the ssllaasshh default library directory.

       ++oo      All  lines in the documentation text contain a per-
              cent (%%) character at the first position.

       ++oo      The first line specifies the index name in the form
              %%II::_n_a_m_e and should not contain whitespaces or other
              text; multiple names in a single entry are  permit-
              ted.

       ++oo      Initial  space and TAB characters after the percent
              character are stripped.

       ++oo      Lines starting with %%@@ are copied verbatim  without
              adjustment or line filling. Depending on the output
              mode, typeface may be changed. Initial  spaces  are
              stripped, but TAB characters are not.

       ++oo      Words  placed inside matching @@ character pairs are
              printed in the verbatim mode typeface.

       ++oo      A new paragraph is started  by  a  line  containing
              only  the  percent  character.  Line  space is also
              inserted before and after verbatim text.

       Documentation text in C source code file is similarly con-
       tained  in  C comment blocks, except that the percents are
       replaced by asterikses and the name id is prefixed with  a
       slash.

       The  following  command  creates  an alphabetically sorted
       index for all S-Lang command files in the current  working
       directory:

              sldoc -i *.sl | sort > sldoc.idx

       To  extract  all  documentation  contained in a file named
       mmyy__lliibb..ssll and format into TeX commands, use:

              sldoc -l my_lib.sl

       If  the VAMPSLIB path is not properly set the command will
       fail.  Otherwise invocation has to be done from within the
       appropriate library directories.
