\chapter{Introduction}
\vamps\ is a one-dimensional water balance model for soils covered by
forest, agricultural crop or bare land particularly suited for use
in tropical environments.  \vamps\ can be used as a complete forest
hydrological model or as a tool to determine just one or more parameters
(e.g. calculate interception using Gash' model). \vamps\ was designed to
be extensible. At the same time the model should be simple to operate. The
model is therefore build in a modular fashion and is equipped with
a simple C-like scripting language.  Features such as  variable time
steps and the ability to select modules allow the model to be used in
both data-rich and data-poor environments.

The model has been developed as part of a collaborative project
'Hydrological modeling in a humid tropical island setting: with
special reference to The Luquillo experimental Forest, Puerto Rico'
between the International Institute of Tropical Forestry and the Vrije
Universiteit Amsterdam \cite{bruijnzeel1994}.  The model is free and
distributed with complete source code. It runs on a variety of operating
systems\footnote{At the moment \vamps{} runs on several operating
systems including \unix\ (\sunos{}, \linux{}, \netbsd\ and \aix{})
\msdos\ and \ostwo{}}.

The soil part of \vamps{} was developed after {\sc
swatr}\footnote{Currently the swap/swatr program is maintained and
documented in by: Dept. of Agrohydrology, Winand Staring Centre
and Dept. of Water Resources, Wageningen Agricultural University}
\cite{feddes1978273}.

\end{table*}
The large number of models that have been developed is an indication
that models need to be tailored or adapted for each specific application.
In order to make \vamps\ easily extensible a C-like interpreted language
\cite{davis1995282,davis1995283} allows the user to redefine builtin
functions with functions tailored to the site in question.  These features
in combination with testing on several tropical sites make the model of
particular importance to those interested in the tropics as a whole and
tropical forests in particular.

The main development goals of \vamps\ are: {\em (i)} make a parameterized
model which can adequately describe the flow of water in a forested
environment (on a plot base) and {\em (ii)} be flexible enough to be
applied to the variety of forested environments that exist.  Due to its
flexibility it is also possible to apply \vamps\ to plots covered with
agricultural crops or bare soils.  Furthermore the software is distributed
with complete source code and documentation to allow the user to adapt the
program to new situations and examine the program's internal operation.


\section*{Model principles}
The flow of water through a forested ecosystem is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:fcycle}. Three pathways are generally distinguished
by which precipitation reaches the forest floor. A small fraction of
the precipitation reaches the forest floor without touching leaves or
stems. This is known as direct throughfall. Another small fraction
flows down the tree trunks as stemflow. The remaining fraction hits
the forest canopy and will leave the canopy as crown drip or evaporate
from the wet canopy depending on canopy storage capacity and shape, the
kinetic energy of the droplets and the atmosphere's evaporative demand.
Water infiltrating the soil profile can runoff laterally as saturated
or unsaturated flow, percolate to deep groundwater or is extracted
by the roots of plants or trees. If the troughfall intensity exceeds
the infiltration capacity of the topsoil, Hortonian overland flow can
occur. The top layer of the soil profile can become saturated resulting
in saturation overland flow. \vamps\ simulates most of these fluxes
which is illustrated in
\begin{figure}
\centerline{\psfig{figure=psfig/fcycle.eps,width=11cm}}
\caption{Simplified diagram of the flow of water through a forested
ecosystem (after \protect\citeasnoun{bruijnzeel1983T})}
\label{fig:fcycle}
\end{figure}
Figure~\ref{fig:vflow}.
The model is mainly driven by input from the atmosphere\footnote{As the
bottom boundary conditions can also change in time one could probably
regard this as a driving force as well}.
\begin{figure}
\centerline{\psfig{figure=psfig/vflow.eps,width=11cm}}
\caption{Simplified flow diagram of the \vamps\ model}
\label{fig:vflow}
\end{figure}

Most of the fluxes in the model can either be calculated or given by
the user. The atmosphere, canopy and soil part of the model can be
combined or used separately. However, the strength of the model is the
ability to combine  these parts into an integrated model for the forest
hydrological cycle.

The following briefly summarizes the methods used to
calculate the water fluxes:
\begin{description}
\item[Throughfall] can be determined in several ways. {\em (1)} using 
a complete canopy water balance model based on the model developed by
 \citeasnoun{rutter1971174}. {\em (2)} using one of the simpler 
analytical approaches by  \citeasnoun{gash1979165} or
 \citeasnoun{calder1986171}.  {\em (3)} the Leaf Area Index based
solution also used by the TOPOG model \cite{vertessy1993140}.

\item[Transpiration] is commonly determined using the Penman-Monteith
equation \cite{monteith1965}. Several alternative methods can be used 
as well \cite{penman1956N,makkink1957,makkink1961,commissie1988N}.

\item[Soil water fluxes] in the unsaturated zone are determined using
Richard's equation. An adapted form of the numerical solution described
by   \citeasnoun{feddes1978273} and  \citeasnoun{belmans1983272} is used.
The relation between water content and pressure head can be
described in several ways 
\cite{genuchten1980179,mualem1976261,clapp1978263}.

\end{description}
These fluxes can also be calculated by a user supplied method.
