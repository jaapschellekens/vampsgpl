# How to use this example?
# --------------------------------------------------------
# To run this file trough vamps give the following command:
#
#	vamps -o example1.out example1.inp
#
# The name op the output-file can be chosen differently.
# After this you will probably want to visualize what has
# happened. Parameters can be extracted from the output-
# file with the vsel command.
# If we want the soil moisture content for layer
# 5 at each time the command to get such a beast would be:
#
#	vsel -p theta -n5 example1.out 
#
# Vsel has come up with a name for the output: theta_5
# In most spreadsheet software you can import such a file
# as a white space or comma separated ascii. Programs
# like gnuplot, graph and matlab can read these files directly.
# To get the whole soil mosture profile at time 4:
#
#	vsel -p theta -t4 example1.out
#
# In this case vsel save the output in 4_theta. If you want other
# names you can use the -o- option and redirect the output
# to a name of your choice.

# Description of the problem
# -------------------------------------------------------------
# In this case potential tranpiration and potential evaporation
# are _NOT_ calculated by the model. The have to be given in 
# ascii format described in ts(5).
# In this case the following files are used:
#	parameter			filename
#	----------------------------------------
#	potential evaporation 		poteva.inp
#	,,	  transpiration		pottra.inp
#	interception			int.inp
#	precipitation			prec.inp
#
# In the soil section a 2m thick sandy profile is defined. It
# includes 20 nodes (layers in the soil section) used in calculations
# and one physical layer. The bottom of the profile includes a fixed
# groundwater level.

# The vamps section
#----------------------------------------
# The vamps section in completely optional but i included
# it here to make this example = silent.

# The determine section
