 - change sat example so that is actually works without S-Lang. The
   filename,1,2 notation is ignored, giving bogus results

   also use this system

 - check malloc bugs in maq.lib

 - add priestly Taylor to libmet
 
 - change Makefile for each lib dir. they should _not_ copy
   the lib, this should be done in the root makefile
