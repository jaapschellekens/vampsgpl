QUICK installation instructions for VAMPS

NOTE!---------------------------------------------------------------------
If you have the plot, slang or agl lib nstalled in a non standard dir set the
environment variable LDFLAGS to the dir so configure can find them. (ex:
setenv LDFLAGS -L/home/user/bob/lib.sun) By default vamps is installed in
/usr/local if your uid < 10 and in ~/ if not.  If an old version of vamps is
found the directory just below that will be used as basedir. If you want
something else use the --prefix=/some/prefix option when running configure.

If you trust the optimizations your compiler makes set the
environment variable CFLAGS to include them as it can speed up
Vamps quite a lot.

(ex: setenv CFLAGS "-O3 -m486 -funroll-loops") <- works fine on my
						  linux box

Source distribution
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirements:
	GNU make
	ANSI C compiler

1)Run the configure script. It is experimental at present but will replace
make.in eventually to comply with GNU standards You may want to edit
vconfig.h and sllib/site.sl

2)If you don't have S-Lang installed on your system, you should build
this first. It is located in the slang.99 dir. Just run configure and
build it.  Optionally install the AGL the gnu plotutils library and
programs and/or gnuplot. This way Vamps can display graphics. It will
work fine without.

3)Do a 'make lib' followed by a 'make all'

4)If this works a 'make install' should be enough to have vamps installed on
your system.

5)The manual pages can be installed by doing a make 'man-install' in the
doc/ directory. The complete manual is in this directory in LaTeX and
PostScript format. 6)Test vamps by running one of the examples. running
'vamps example1.inp' in the examples/1/ directory should do the trick.



Bin distribution
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
UNIX

1)Copy the files in the 'your_unix_system' directory to a directory in your
path (or leave them where they are and adjust the path).

2)if you copy the files in share to the dir used when building the
binaries, vamps can run without the VAMPSLIB environment variable,
otherwise you will have to set VAMPSLIB to the directory in which the
files are installed (e.g.  /usr/local/lib/vamps/)

3)The manual pages can be installed by doing a 'make man-install' in
the doc/ directory. The complete manual can be found in this directory
in LaTeX and PostScript format.

4)Take vamps for a quick testrun by running vamps on the example1.inp file
in the examples/1 directory

MS-DOS (poorly supported at present)

1)Copy the files from the msdos directory to a directory in your path (or
leave them were they are and adjust the path).

2)If you copy the files in sllib to c:\vamps vamps can run without the
VAMPSLIB environment variable, otherwise you will have to set VAMPSLIB to
the directory in which the files are installed (e.g. d:\vamps\lib)

3)Preformatted manual pages are present in the doc directory as well as
complete documentation in LaTeX and PostScript format.

4)Take vamps for a quick testrun by running vamps on the example1.inp file
in the examples\1 directory
